# KPMG - Virtual Experience Program




## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation,needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
 - Customer Demographic
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data

You can check the [Dataset](https://cdn-assets.theforage.com/vinternship_modules/kpmg_data_analytics/KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final.xlsx) here.


## Problem
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation.
We have to reveal useful customer insights which could help optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high value customers.

The task has been divided into three segments:

-  Task 1 - Data Quality 
-  Task 2 - Data Insights
-  Task 3 - Data Insights and Presentation
## Data Quality
We have to draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.

## Data Insights
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour. 

Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, we have to recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which I will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

We have to prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.

## Data Insights and Presentation
We have to develop a dashboard that can be presented to the client at our next meeting. Display our data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard.

It is important to keep in mind the business context when presenting our findings:

- What are the trends in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s   marketing and growth strategy?
- Specifically, our presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.

## Conclusion
Marketing team should deploy the targeted model based on the following:
- Customer between the age 30 to 49.
- Male customers in the mid-year i.e April - July and in the midweek around Thursday.
- Female customers around October and in the start of the weekend Saturday.
- Customers related to Financial Services and Manufacturing Industries.
- Solex brand and Standard product as the top priority.
- Customers in the Mass Consumer Segment.
- Customers living in New South Wales.
